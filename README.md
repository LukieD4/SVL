# SVL
Seamless Video Looper    
> Message will be removed soon: files are still being updated and should be finished by tonight (15/09/24-4:52pm-UK).   

A puddle of python scripts used to query the user with a set basis of parameters to curate a Seamless Video.

A relatively short project that may recieve updates periodically.
This project was designed for fun and ease to trim short form content used for GIF repetition / loops.

Sample video was found at random and taken from:
https://www.furaffinity.net/view/52184319/
(I do not own this video, nor is it condemned under the liscense for this project)  

# Supported platforms  
> Windows ✅  
> Linux ❓  
> MacOS ❓
   
Will there be support outside of windows? Ideally no,
  everything that may be supported is merely coincidental,
    but I'll be glad if it does magically work on other platforms.
