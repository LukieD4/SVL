Seamless Video Looper

A puddle of python scripts used to query the user with a set basis of parameters to curate a Seamless Video.

A relatively short project that may recieve updates periodically.
This project was designed for fun and ease to trim short form content used for GIF repetition / loops.

Sample video was found at random and taken from:
https://www.furaffinity.net/view/52184319/
(I do not own this video, nor is it condemned under the liscense for this project)
